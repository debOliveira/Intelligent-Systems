This repository contains **different controllers based on a P3DX vehicle plant**. The process was simulated in CoppeliaSim, and the actuation was done through MATLAB API. The experiments are numbered as:

1. [Kinematics and dynamic modeling](https://github.com/debOliveira/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Exp1%20-%20Modeling) 
2. [P and PD control law with direct access to state-space](https://github.com/debOliveira/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Exp2%20-%20P%20and%20PD%20control%20law)
3. [Error estimation using inferior line following sensor post-processing (neural networks)](https://github.com/debOliveira/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Exp3%20-%20Sensor%20neural%20network%20post-processing)
4. [PID tuning based on genetic algorithms](https://github.com/debOliveira/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Exp4%20-%20PID%20tuning%20genetic%20algorithms)
5. [Fuzzy control](https://github.com/debOliveira/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Exp5%20-%20Fuzzy%20control)
6. [PID tuning based on expert systems](https://github.com/debOliveira/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Exp6%20-%20PID%20tuning%20expert%20systems)
7. [Measurement correction with Extended Kalman filter](https://github.com/debOliveira/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Exp7%20-%20Extended%20Kalman%20filter)

Each experiment folder contains a script folder, a pictures folder and a report PDF file. 

This study was based on the subject "Intelligent Automation", chaired by Professor Antonio Marcus Nogueira Lima in the Electrical Engineering bachelor degree course in the Federal University of Campina Grande.
