This repository contains **different controllers based on a P3DX vehicle plant**. The process was simulated in CoppeliaSim, and the actuation was done through MATLAB API. The experiments are numbered as:

1. Kinematics and dynamic modelling 
2. P and PD control law with direct access to state-space
3. Error estimation using inferior line following sensor post-processing (neural networks)
4. PID tuning based on genetic algorithms
5. Fuzzy control
6. PID tuning based on expert systems
7. Measuaremnt correction with Extended Kalman filter

Each experiment folder contains a script folder and a report PDF file. A pictures folder can also be available in some experiments.
